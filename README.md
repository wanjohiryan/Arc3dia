**[qwantify](https://qwantify.vercel.app)** lets you run PC games (.exe) on a shared host computer with at least one gpu with no extra configurations. _Everything just runs perfectly._

>Note: this was previously a fork of m1k1o's n.eko as a proof of concept. However, as of v0.1.1, they are no  longer backwards compatible.
>This project is (still) in active maintenance. Currently working on the qwantify-core 'engine' [here](https://github.com/wanjohiryan/warp) - gamepad support and nvenc/vaapi encoding.

## üåû Motivation
I've always wanted to stream games from different devices while playing them on the fly, and occasionally I even wanted to invite others.
 
Although cloud gaming providers offered this, I preferred a self-hosted version so that I could manage and run my own games.

I then discovered [Parsec](https://www.parsec.app), which was fantastic when it functioned but absolutely useless when the network experienced any little instability.The lack of a web interface and the requirement to install native apps only served to magnify the issue.

I came upon m1k1o's [n.eko](https://github.com/m1k1o/neko) and after making some adjustments for my nvidia GPU, it worked!

Now i could play online with anyone, run multiple games on the same machine, save and sync game progress between computers. It was a miracle.

>And that's how qwantify was born :)

## üíò Features

> qwantify was, to some degree, inspired by Google Stadia

## üöÄ Get started

To quickly get started, pull the image and run it with docker compose (*recommended*)

Requirements:

1. Linux or WSL
   >qwantify doesn't work on windows/Mac as they cannot pass gpus to linux containers
   
2. Latest version of docker and docker compose
3. A machine with GPU: **Nvidia, AMD or Intel**
  
  >For machines with Nvidia GPUs you will need: `nvidia-docker` and
   `nvidia container toolkit` v450.80.02 or higher

```bash
version: "3.8"
services:
  qwantify:
    image: wanjohiryan/qwantify:latest #or ghcr.io/wanjohiryan/qwantify:20.04
    restart: "unless-stopped"
    ports:
      - "8080:8080" #web interface
    volumes:
      - /games:/games #directory with folders containing your game(s)
    shm_size:'5gb' #size of shared memory
    deploy:
      resources:
        reservations:
          devices: #share nvidia gpu (recommended)
            - capabilities: [gpu] 
        limits:
          memory: 5G #depends on the game (recommended is 4)
          cpus: '4' #depends on the game (recommended is 4)
    devices:
      - /dev/dri:/dev/dri #pass in Intel or AMD GPUs
    environment:
      - APPPATH=/path/to/game/folder #folder containing the game
      - APPFILE=/game.exe #game executable file

```

Then run

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

## üî• What's cool about this?

Not only do you stream games with qwantify, you get the best GPU & CPU performance optimisations, all specifically tailored for the game you're playing.

Additionally, you get high quality 1080p@60fps streams to any browser on the same LAN or online.

>We're on a mission to make games more accessible to all, <i>not just gamers with expensive hardware</i>. 

## üîÑ Comparisons with other software
>Note: qwantify is not **JUST** streaming software

[Parsec](https://parsec.app/):Parsec is not open-source. . It only offers the best performance on Windows or Mac hosts, though and does not function in the browser. It also does not come with performance optimizations pre-installed.

[CloudMorph](https://github.com/giongto35/cloud-morph): Cloudmorph uses WebRTC as opposed to qwantify, which uses QUIC/HTTP3. Additionally, it doesn't implement any hardware acceleration.

[n.eko](https://github.com/m1k1o/neko): neko uses WebRTC as opposed to qwantify, which uses QUIC/HTTP3. It also does not support gamepads/joysticks.
